THE SHADE
Song by Rex Orange County


Lyrics

Two, three, four
I was closin' all the blinds just so you could sleep the night through
I was stayin' by your side just so I knew you were okay
Then I was openin' the door just to see if you would walk through
I started paintin' all the walls just to see if you liked the shade
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else, no
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
You were holdin' out your hands, hopin' I'd be there to hold to
I went out to Amsterdam just so I could give you some space
But I kept openin' my door just to see if you would walk through
But now I'm paintin' all my walls just to see if you like the shade
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else, no
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
Not with anybody else, anybody else
Please don't go
Not with anybody else, anybody else, no
Please don't go
