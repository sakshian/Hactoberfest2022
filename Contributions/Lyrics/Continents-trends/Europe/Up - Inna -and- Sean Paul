Lyrics
Once upon a time, there was a girl who made a wish
To find herself a love and finally make a switch
Then you came around, you healed another stitch
And I'm glad about that, I can finally make the switch
And I know, yeah I know
Many would like to be in my shoes
And I know, yeah I know
With you, I got nothin' to lose
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt, you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt, you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
You can use that magic touch
You can use that magic touch
I was running all the time, babe, you came and slowed me down
It's me, myself and you now, I'm levitating off the ground
And when you came around, you healed another stitch
I was lost, but now you found me, I can finally make the switch
And I know, yeah I know
Many would like to be in my shoes
And I know, yeah I know
With you, I got nothin' to lose
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt, you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt, you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
You can use that magic touch
You can use that magic touch
