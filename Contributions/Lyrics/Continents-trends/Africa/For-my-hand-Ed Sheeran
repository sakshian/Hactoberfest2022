Lyrics

I wanna be in your life until the night is over
I wanna hold you so tight, so tight, come in closer
It's been a hell of a ride for every single moment
You were there by my side
Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole
Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul
Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my home
Whenever you doubt it, I'll be lettin' you know
Whoa, girl, I want to be dancin' with you forever
You see through the storm and take me as I am
Baby, it's magic any time that we're together
I make I just love you and hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand, my hand, my hand
Hold you for my hand, hold you for my hand
Over and over again, yeah, my love is burning, baby
Feels like time is frozen and the night is for us
And we're alone again and every moment's golden, yeah
Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love
Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole (ooh-whoa)
Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul (ooh-whoa)
Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my home
Whenever you doubt it, I'll be lettin' you know
Whoa, girl, I want to be dancin' with you forever
You see through the storm and take me as I am
Baby, it's magic any time that we're together
I make I just love you and hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand, my hand, my hand
Hold you for my hand, hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand, my hand, my hand
Hold you for my hand, hold you for my hand (hand)
I wanna be in your life until the night is over
I wanna hold you so tight, so tight, come in closer
I wanna be in your life until the night is over
Until the night is over, until the night is over
