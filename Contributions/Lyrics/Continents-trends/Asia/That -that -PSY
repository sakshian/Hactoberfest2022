Lyrics


PSY coming back (이리 오너라)
Long time no see, huh? 오래간만이지, huh?
우리 다시 웃고 울고 지지고 볶고, let's get loco
Pandemic's over, uh, 그래, 기분이 오져, uh
다시 그분이 오죠, uh, everybody say
뻑적지근해, 걸쩍지근해
시끌벅적거리네, 너무 좋아 북적거리네
동서남북, ayy, 강남강북, ayy
싹 다 모여, throw your hands in the air, I say, "Yeah"
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Whoa-oh-oh, yeah, whoa, whoa
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Oh-oh-oh, yeah (oh)
준비하시고 (go), 쏘세요 (oh)
That, that, I like that (like that)
기분 좋아, babe (babe)
흔들어 좌, 우, 위, 아래로 (sing it)
One, two, three to the four (sing it)
That, that, I like that
That, that, I like that, baby
That, that, I like that
It's like that, that, yo
That, that, I like that
That, that, I like that, baby
That, that, I like that
It's like that
야, 내가 뭐 하는 사람인지 까먹었지?
(That, that, I like that) like that
시간이 지나도 변함없이
(That, that, I like that) haha, like that
I don't care, I don't care, that, I like that
(That, that, I like that) like that
내가 바라보고 바라왔던 사람들아
모두 다 ready, set, go
되려 늘어난 맷집 때리던 분이 불편하겠지
너네 바람대로 망할 거라 고사 지낸
사람들을 모아다가 가볍게 때찌
적당히 하라고, oh, oh, oh
그냥 닥치고 다 같이 놀아보자고, oh, oh, oh
민윤기와 박재상
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Whoa-oh-oh, yeah, whoa, whoa
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Oh-oh-oh, yeah (oh)
준비하시고 (go), 쏘세요 (oh)
That, that, I like that (like that)
기분 좋아, babe (babe)
흔들어 좌, 우, 위, 아래로 (sing it)
One, two, three to the four (sing it)
That, that, I like that
That, that, I like that, baby
That, that, I like that
It's like that, that, yo
That, that, I like that
That, that, I like that, babe
That, that, I like that
It's like that, that, yo
Do what you wanna (ah, yah, yah)
Say what you wanna (ah, yah, yah)
Do what you wanna (say what?)
That, that, I like that, baby
Do what you wanna (ah, yah, yah)
Say what you wanna (ah, yah, yah)
Do what you wanna (say what?)
That, that, I like that, baby
That, that, I like that
