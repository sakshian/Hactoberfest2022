Fantastic
Song by Tyga

Lyrics


Uh, Honey Buns poppin' out the plastic, stretched like elastic
Just took a thizz and I feel fantastic
The pussy was great, I'm just bein' sarcastic
Hungry for the money, I'm a fuckin' fat bastard
Reebok that beat, I'm just tryna make a classic
Dressed in Prada and I look fantastic
Flippin' that bitch, she don't know gymnastics
We gon' make it nasty, feels fantastic
Is them titties real? 'Cause they feel like plastic
Ashin' out the blunt with a bitch name Ashley
Run up on me wrong, put you in a casket
Turn you to a ghost, bring you back, black magic
Bitch be suckin' me off like Magi
Hit me on the 'Gram and she say, "Send the addy"
I replied, "Gladly"
Uber in the navi'
And you know my ex-bitch can't get past me
Thumpin' the trunk, get you stumped in a dump, yeah
Hump in the pump and I cum on her tongue, yeah
Her ex was a chump and I let her have fun, yeah
I don't give her time, rather be with my son, yeah
Walkin' on mink (mink), she my lil' stink (stink)
Fuckin' for hours (hours), I'm off the zinc (zinc)
Sippin' my drink (drink), fuck what you think (think)
Fingers in the pussy, big pinky ring
Uh, Honey Buns poppin' out the plastic, stretched like elastic
Just took a thizz and I feel fantastic
The pussy was great, I'm just bein' sarcastic
Hungry for the money, I'm a fuckin' fat bastard
Reebok that beat, I'm just tryna make a classic
Dressed in Prada and I look fantastic
Flippin' that bitch, she don't know gymnastics
We gon' make it nasty, feels fantastic
Yeah, shake that ass, yeah, work that ass
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that ass, wanna touch that ass
Can you make it go 'round and 'round?
Step up in the club, they like, "Who you with?" (who you with)
T-Raww in this bitch, yeah, he the shit
Yeah, I'm young but the money so mature and shit
She at my crib walkin' 'round on some tourist shit
Yeah, who's that jumpin' in the Cadillac?
Bitches in the G-Wagon, she a bachelorette
They all wanna date me like I'm the bachelor
How she in love with me? I ain't even met her
They don't even know me (no)
They all wanna show me (show me)
Girl, what that mouth do? They say it's mine only (it's mine)
I don't believe it but I entertain it (yeah)
Twelve hour flight and the bitch almost fainted (you okay?)
Uh, Honey Buns poppin' out the plastic, stretched like elastic
Just took a thizz and I feel fantastic
The pussy was great, I'm just bein' sarcastic
Hungry for the money, I'm a fuckin' fat bastard
Reebok that beat, I'm just tryna make a classic
Dressed in Prada and I look fantastic
Flippin' that bitch, she don't know gymnastics
We gon' make it nasty, feels fantastic
Yeah, shake that ass, yeah, work that ass
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that ass, wanna touch that ass
Can you make it go 'round and 'round?
Yeah, shake that ass, yeah, work that ass
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that ass, wanna touch that ass
Can you make it go 'round and 'round?
Yeah, the shit fantastic
And my bitch fantastic
And the whip fantastic
Bitch, I'm fantastic
Why'd you like my picture, honey
And you don't answer me
You left me on seen
