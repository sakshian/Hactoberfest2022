[Chorus: will.i.am, will.i.am & Shakira, Shakira]
Don't you worry
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
So don't you worry
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 1: will.i.am, will.i.am & Shakira, Shakira, apl.de.ap, (apl.de.ap & Shakira)]
It's gon' be al-, be alright, thumbs up vibe
Ready for the night, lit like a light
'Bout to take a flight, get higher than a kite
Floatin' on the sky, look mama, I can fly
I feel so alive, I'ma live my best life
Do just, do just what I like
Get that, get that, get that press
I was down now I (rise up)
Head up and my (eyes up)
I keep getting (wiser)
Then I realize (that everything will be)

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Shakira, Shakira]
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-kay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, okay
This is how we do it, baby, this is what we say
Eso es lo que tú y yo vamo' a hacer

[Chorus: Shakira, will.i.am, Both]
Don't you worry
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
So don't you worry


Don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2: (will.i.am), Taboo, Shakira, Taboo & Shakira, apl.de.ap & Taboo, (apl.de.ap, Taboo & will.i.am)]
(It's gon' be, on' be okay) (Ey)
Work hard, play hard, that's the only way (Ey)
I'ma live my life like everyday's a holiday (Ey)
Time to celebrate (Ey), time to elevate
Hold up, wait
Tres, cuatro, cinco, seis
Take it to the top, top, top, like, "Ooh"
We don't stop, stop, keep on movin' makin' moves
Take a a shot, shot, take a shot, take a few
We gon' keep on doin' what we do
('Cause everyday will be)


[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Shakira, Shakira]

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
